#' Match date values
#'
#' This function is used to match dates when doing probabalistic matched. Rather than doing simple string or numeric comparison, it includes a few options through which potential matches can be evaluated.
#' @param data A linked dataframe based on probablistic matching of non-date fields.
#' @param date1 The date from the first matched dataset
#' @param date2 The date from the second matched dataset
#' @param exact Should only exact matches be retained? Default value is FALSE.
#' @param switch Should pairs that match once day and month are reversed in one date be kept? Default is TRUE.
#' @param threshold How many days is an acceptable difference between two dates? Default is 5, set to 0 to ignore.
#' @export

#This function is designed to be used during probalistic matching after two datasets have already been joined based on names etc.
#Typically use this before filtering out potential matches based on the match weight from the prior join.
#It's designed to allow matching of dates, taking into account some potential issues that may commonly occur.
#1) You have the option of only taking exact date matches. We often do this.
#2) You have the option of also keeping pairs that match once date and month have been switched. This can keep real matches affected by input errors.
#3) You can keep dates within a specified day range. Small differences may also be the result on input errors.
#After this function drops some potential matches, the remainder can be evaluated (automatically or manually) based on match weight and other info
